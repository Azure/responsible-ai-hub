In this workshop you will learn how to use the prebuilt AI service, Azure Safety Content, in your applications to ensure that the texts or images that are sent to the user or the user enters do not contain data that has violence, self-harm, hate or sexual information.  In addition, based on the demographic of the end-users that interact with the application, developers can control what content is acceptable based on the sensitivity level of the inappropriate content.

However, there are instances where we need to use our own data and narrow the actions and data search of our LLM prompts to focus only on the scope of our data or expand the data from LLM model to include our data as well.  To use your own data in a LLM, you need to convert you data into numeric values.  Each word mapping to a specific number (token).  Then you train a model to find similarities, collations, or word association, the model creates vector indexes to the word associations.   The good thing is the Prompt Flow service provide an easy-to-use process your to upload dataset and it generates model and the Vector indexes.","sidebar":"promptFlowSidebar"},"azure-prompt-flow/lab5-chatbot-with-your-data/pf-chatbot-with-your-data-lab5\'":{"id":"azure-prompt-flow/lab5-chatbot-with-your-data/pf-chatbot-with-your-data-lab5\'","title":"Lab# 5: Chatbot to use your data","description":"In the precise exercise you create a vector index and train to search for your vector embeddings.
