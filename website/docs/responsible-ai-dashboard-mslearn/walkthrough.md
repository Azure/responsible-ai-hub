The [**Responsible AI Dashboard Learn Module**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-responsibleai-dashboard) takes about an hour to complete end-to-end, and can take a little longer if you factor in time for exploration and data entry. You might also run into issues or have questions about what _should have happened_ at a specific point in the lab, to help you debug or understand concepts better.

**This no-audio video recording of the learn module can help**. The tables below show you the timestamps for each relevant step, within this video. Just visit the YouTube page and open the description to get _pre-linked_ key moments to jump directly to the relevant segments to review walkthrough steps for reference.
